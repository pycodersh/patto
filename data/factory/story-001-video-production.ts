Warm amber overhead carriage lighting. Cool blue-white city light flickering intermittently through the dark window behind him — blurred streaks of orange, white, and gold. He leans his head slightly against the window. His eyes are distant, half-lidded, exhausted but peacefully empty. Natural, subtle breathing motion. A slow blink every few seconds. Camera: very slow push-in, barely perceptible — starts medium shot and ends medium close-up on his face over 8 seconds. Shallow depth of field. Warm amber tones with cool blue rim light from the window. Film grain overlay. No text, no dialogue, no music, no subtitles. Seamless loop. Aspect ratio 16:9. Cinematic color grade. High quality, realistic human motion.`,

Mood: Exhausted, peaceful, end-of-week quiet
Style: Cinematic, film grain, shallow DOF, warm-cool color contrast
Duration: 8 seconds, seamless loop
No dialogue, no text, no music`,

    tool_kling: `[Kling 1.6 / 2.0]
A tired young man sits alone in a night train, leaning against the dark window. City lights streak and blur outside. Warm amber overhead light. His expression is calm and distant — end-of-long-week quiet. Barely any movement: slow breathing, occasional blink, eyes drifting. Camera slowly pushes in over 8 seconds. Film grain. Warm interior vs cool window light. Seamless 8-second loop. No dialogue.`,

    tool_veo: `[Google Veo 2 / Veo 3]
Cinematic scene. Night train interior. A young professional man sits alone, watching blurred city lights through the dark window. Amber cabin glow. His posture is relaxed, slightly tired. Eyes half-closed, faraway expression. Very subtle camera push-in movement. Warm vs cool lighting contrast. Film grain. 8-second seamless loop. Realistic. No speech, no text.`,

    tool_universal: `Cinematic 8-second clip in two beats. Beat 1 (0–3s): The same young man from the train scene now looks down at his vibrating phone. Phone screen glow lights his face in the dark carriage — cool blue-white light against warm amber. He reads. A micro-beat of hesitation. Then a slow, genuine, natural smile spreads across his face — not performed, it arrives. He looks up. A quiet decision behind his eyes. Beat 2 (3–8s): He stands, grabs his bag with calm purpose. The train slows. Doors slide open. He steps onto a night station platform under bright fluorescent lights. He glances at the platform sign, then turns his body with quiet confidence — as if the night has just changed direction. Camera: starts tight on phone (phone light fills lower frame), pulls back naturally as he stands, follows him to the door, holds on him on the platform. Organic, naturalistic movement. Shallow depth of field. No dialogue. No music. Station ambient sound implied. 8 seconds. Seamless loop point: back to phone buzz. Cinematic. Film grain. High quality.`,

Two-beat scene. Beat 1: Man on night train, phone buzzes, he reads, genuine smile. Beat 2: He stands, steps off train, arrives on night platform with quiet purpose.

Lighting: Phone screen glow in dark carriage → bright station fluorescent
Mood: Surprise → hesitation → quiet decision
Duration: 8 seconds, loop at phone buzz
No dialogue. Cinematic grain.`,

    tool_kling: `[Kling]
Young man on a night train. His phone buzzes. He looks down — phone light on his face. He reads something. Pauses. Then smiles — naturally, slowly. He stands up. Steps off at the next station. On the platform now, he looks around with quiet confidence. Camera follows him naturally. Warm carriage → bright platform. 8 seconds, seamless loop. No dialogue.`,

    tool_veo: `[Veo]
A young man receives a text on a night train. His phone lights his face. He reads. A real smile — not performed. He makes a decision and gets off at the next station. Platform fluorescent light. He pauses, then turns with purpose. Camera: close on phone, pulls back as he moves, holds on platform. 8 seconds. Cinematic. No speech.`,

    tool_universal: `Cinematic 8-second clip with cross-dissolve transition at the 4-second mark. Part A (0–4s): A warm apartment living room at night. 6–8 young adults in their 20s and 30s — talking, laughing, someone pouring a drink, two people leaning in to share something funny. The protagonist is visible slightly off-center — genuinely smiling, present in the moment. Warm golden pendant lighting (2400K). Soft ambient party music at low volume, natural laughter, the clink of glasses. Camera drifts slowly, rack focus from foreground to protagonist. Intimate and alive. Part B (4–8s): Cross-dissolve — the warm gold party light bleeds into warm amber train light. The same young man now sits alone on a nearly empty late-night train. He looks out the dark window at softer, slower city lights — fewer cars, quieter streets. His expression is peaceful, content, quietly moved. A private smile: he is still with the night. His eyes close very slowly at the very end. Camera mirrors Scene 1 push-in — intentional visual callback. The city lights outside are gentler than before. Cross-dissolve at 4s bridges the two spaces with a color match — golden party warmth into golden train amber. Seamless loop. No dialogue. No music. Cinematic. Film grain. High quality.`,

Two-part scene with dissolve.
Part A (0–4s): Warm apartment party. Friends laughing, talking, drinks. Golden pendant light. Protagonist genuinely smiling in background.
Part B (4–8s): DISSOLVE to — same man, late-night train, soft city lights, peaceful private smile, eyes slowly close.
Camera A: slow rack focus drift. Camera B: slow push-in (mirrors Scene 1).
Color match dissolve — golden party → golden carriage amber.
Seamless loop. No dialogue. Cinematic grain.`,

    tool_kling: `[Kling]
Part 1: Warm apartment. A group of friends laughing and talking under golden lights. The protagonist smiles genuinely in the scene.
Cross-dissolve at 4 seconds.
Part 2: Late-night train. Same man. Alone. Soft city lights out the window. Peaceful expression — still carrying the warmth of the night. Camera slowly pushes in. His eyes close at the end.
8 seconds total. Seamless loop. Film grain. No dialogue.`,

    tool_veo: `[Veo]
Scene begins at a warm apartment gathering — friends, laughter, golden light. At 4 seconds, a soft cross-dissolve transitions to a quiet late-night train: the same man sits alone, looking out at soft blurred city lights, a quiet smile of contentment. Camera mirrors the opening train scene. The city outside looks gentler, softer. Eyes close slowly. 8 seconds. Cinematic. No dialogue.`,
