Soft natural morning light through sheer curtains. Cozy, minimal home interior. Relaxed and content expression. Film grain. Warm-neutral tones. Magazine lifestyle editorial photography. 4:3 aspect ratio.`,
      videoPrompt: `A young woman sits on a sofa, cradling a coffee mug. Morning light fills the room through white curtains. She glances down as her phone buzzes on the cushion beside her. She picks it up. Her expression shifts from peaceful to quietly surprised. Camera: gentle slow push-in. 5–8 seconds. Seamless loop. No dialogue. Soft ambient morning sounds only.`,

Light, purposeful energy.`,
