Their phone buzzes with a text invitation from a friend. They hesitate, then smile and change direction back toward the city.

Warm natural lighting, realistic human motion, gentle camera movement, cozy evening mood, no dialogue, no text on screen, ambient sound only, 24 seconds.`,

Warm amber overhead carriage lighting. Cool blue-white city light flickering through the dark window — blurred streaks of orange, white, and gold. He leans his head slightly against the window. Eyes distant, half-lidded, exhausted but peacefully empty. Natural breathing motion, a slow blink every few seconds. Camera: very slow push-in, barely perceptible — starts medium shot and ends medium close-up on his face over 8 seconds. Shallow depth of field. Warm amber tones with cool blue rim from window. Film grain. No text, no dialogue, no music. Seamless loop. 16:9. Cinematic color grade. High quality, realistic human motion.`,
      ambiencePrompt: `Ambient train interior sound. Evening commuter train. Steady rhythmic wheel clacking on rails. Low engine hum underneath. Very soft air conditioning fan.
