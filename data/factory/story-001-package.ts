      paragraphIds: ['p1-1'],
      patternIds: ['pt1-1'],
      imagePrompt: `Tired young professional in a moving train carriage at night. Looking out the window at blurred city lights. Soft overhead cabin lighting. Slightly melancholy but peaceful expression. Cinematic composition. Film grain texture. Magazine photography quality. 4:3 aspect ratio.`,
      videoPrompt: `Cinematic 8-second clip. A young man in his late 20s sits alone by the window in a quiet train carriage at night. Work bag on his lap, smart casual clothes. Warm amber overhead carriage lighting. Cool blue-white city light flickering through the dark window — blurred streaks of orange, white, and gold. He leans his head slightly against the window. Eyes distant, half-lidded, exhausted but peacefully empty. Natural breathing motion, a slow blink every few seconds. Camera: very slow push-in, barely perceptible — starts medium shot and ends medium close-up on his face over 8 seconds. Shallow depth of field. Warm amber tones with cool blue rim from window. Film grain. No text, no dialogue, no music. Seamless loop. 16:9. Cinematic color grade. High quality, realistic human motion.`,
      ambiencePrompt: `Ambient train interior sound. Evening commuter train. Steady rhythmic wheel clacking on rails. Low engine hum underneath. Very soft air conditioning fan. Barely audible distant voices — two or three passengers, completely indistinct. Occasional PA station chime echoing faintly in the distance. No music. No announcements. Peaceful and steady. Volume: low. Loop: seamless 30-second or longer.`,

      imagePrompt: `Young man on a night train, looking down at his glowing phone screen with a quiet smile. Warm screen light on his face. Other passengers slightly out of focus in background. Candid street photography style. Shallow depth of field. Cinematic grain.`,
      videoPrompt: `Cinematic 8-second clip, two beats. Beat 1 (0–3s): The same young man on the train looks down at his vibrating phone. Phone screen glow — cool blue-white light — illuminates his face in the dark carriage. He reads. A micro-beat of hesitation. Then a slow, genuine smile spreads naturally. He looks up: a quiet decision. Beat 2 (3–8s): He stands, grabs his bag with calm purpose. Doors slide open. He steps onto a night station platform under bright fluorescent lights. He glances at the platform sign, then turns with quiet confidence — as if the night has just changed direction. Camera: starts tight on phone, pulls back as he stands, follows him to the door, holds on him on the platform. Organic movement. No dialogue. 8 seconds. Seamless loop at phone buzz. Film grain. Cinematic.`,
      ambiencePrompt: `Urban train station platform ambience, evening. Train wheels slowing and stopping. Train door chime — pneumatic slide. Footsteps on concrete platform. Medium-density crowd ambient — not rush hour, but active. Distant PA echo. Faint city sounds from outside station entrance — traffic, wind. Purposeful, transitional energy. Volume: medium-low.

      videoPrompt: `Cinematic 8-second clip with cross-dissolve at 4-second mark. Part A (0–4s): A warm apartment living room at night. 6–8 young adults talking, laughing, someone pouring a drink, two people leaning in sharing something funny. The protagonist visible slightly off-center — genuinely smiling, present. Warm golden pendant lighting (2400K). Camera slow rack focus from foreground to protagonist. Part B (4–8s): Cross-dissolve — golden party light bleeds into warm amber train light. Same young man on a near-empty late-night train. He looks out at softer, slower city lights. A private smile. Eyes close slowly at the very end. Camera mirrors Scene 1 push-in — intentional visual callback. Color-matched dissolve: golden party → golden train amber. Seamless loop. No dialogue. Film grain. Cinematic.`,
      ambiencePrompt: `Two-part ambient audio with crossfade. Part A: Small apartment gathering — 6–8 people, natural overlapping conversation and laughter, very low-volume soft instrumental background music, occasional glass clink, warm room acoustics. Part B (crossfades at midpoint): Late-night near-empty train — same wheel rhythm as opening scene but slightly slower and quieter, near-empty carriage air, barely one distant passenger. The contrast: warm alive sound → peaceful quiet. Volume: low. Loop: seamless.`,
